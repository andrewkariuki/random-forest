# random-forest-
Random forest is a flexible, easy to use machine learning algorithm that produces, even without hyper-parameter tuning, a great result most of the time. It is also one of the most used algorithms, because of its simplicity and diversity (it can be used for both classification and regression tasks). In this post we'll learn how the random forest algorithm works, how it differs from other algorithms and how to use it.
